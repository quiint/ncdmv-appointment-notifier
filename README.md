# ncdmv-appointment-notifier

Receive a notification when an appointment is available at your favorite NC DMV locations.

## Note

The new NC DMV system is designed to circumvent automated queries. To stay
maintainable and under the radar, this script requires you to program which sites you are interested in.

## Requirements

* Go 1.19 or newer
* curl
* This probably works on pretty much anywhere, but only tested on macOS so far

## Installation

## Usage

```shell
ncdmv-appointment-notifier
```

It's that easy! There are a number of flags for tuning the behavior of this program:

* `--max-notify-days`: only notify if a reservation is available within this many days (default 30)
* `--refresh-delay`: how long to wait between refreshes if no matching appointments are found (default 9m0s)
* `--found-delay`: how long to wait between refreshes if a matching appointment is found (default 1h0m0s)
* `--run-command`: alert command to run (must accept a string argument) (default "say")
* `--sites-directory`: path to sites content (default "sites/")

## Example Output

On macOS, Linux, and Windows, this program will generate a desktop notification:

If your computer has the "say" command installed (macOS), ncdmv-appointment-notifier will also speak the contents of the  notification out loud. You can use `--run-command` to set an alternative tool, such as `espeak`.

There is also useful logging output for diagnostics:

## Defining your acceptable DMV sites

To define which offices you are interested, you will need to modify the contents of the `sites/` subdirectory. Out of the box, this program comes with a couple of sample sites (Carrboro, Hillsborough, etc).

To program a site, you will need to create a text file in the `sites/` subdirectory containing the appropriate request data.
